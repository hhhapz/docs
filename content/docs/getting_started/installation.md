## Installation

`xo` is written in Go and uses Go templates with the 1.16 `embed` package. To
compile `xo`, you will need to use at least Go 1.16.

### 1. Install Go

For Linux users, you can use your favorite package installer to install Go:

```shell
$ aptitude install go
$ pacman -S go
$ yum install golang
```

Mac users can use Homebrew to install Go, or download it from the [Go
website â†’](https://golang.org/dl)

```shell
$ brew install go
```

For Windows, Go can be installed through
[Chocolatey â†’](https://chocolatey.org/install) or from the [Go
website â†’](https://golang.org/dl)

### 2. Install `xo`

Install `xo` in the usual Go way:

```shell
$ go get -u github.com/xo/xo
```

## Notes: Go users

### 2.1 Install goimports

`xo` uses goimports to format generated Go code. To install it:

```shell
$ go get -u golang.org/x/tools/cmd/goimports
```

Go code generated by `xo` is compatible with Go versions as old as Go 1.3.
